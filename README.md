# Sonnet Generator with LSTM
Train a simple LSTM implemented with Tensorflow/Keras. <br>
The LSTM model learns from the original corpus of 152 Sonnets by Shakespeare. <br>
Given a start line, the model will predict the next word one by one and finish the Sonnet by itself. <br>
<br>
Currently, due to the small size of original data, the model does not perform very well.
The train data contains 3330 words. The model can reach 13% acurracy guessing the next word, on unseen validation data. 
<br>
### Here is one example that is generated by the model:<br>
*Help me Obi Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope **(Input line)** <br>
all hear , are they , are many , to those <br>
as nights they rich her ground ; <br>
thou gavest my youth and you with thee ? <br>
alas of this part , love in one <br>
are objects of this honey hours ; <br>
for purest and wrinkles out , <br>
although left thy charge age , <br>
which almost gaze fresh such that but see aside: <br>
since at the willing kindness mayst the prophetic away , <br>
for borrow'd others' at their bastard and after-loss: <br>
so makest love-kindling leaves ; <br>
but there are fell thing in base on thee , <br>
the beauty why lends which you weak with cross , <br>
thou art in this one world was goes eyes ,* <br>
